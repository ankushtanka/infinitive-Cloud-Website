              Affordable VPS Hosting India — Full Root Access
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our VPS hosting plans give you dedicated resources at a fraction of the cost of a physical server. Each virtual private server runs on enterprise-grade Intel Xeon processors with NVMe SSD storage, ensuring blazing-fast read/write speeds for your applications and databases. Unlike shared hosting, your VPS resources are fully isolated — other users on the same physical server can never impact your performance.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              With full root access, you can install any software, configure custom firewall rules, and optimise your server environment exactly how you want. Our KVM-based virtualisation ensures true hardware isolation. Plans start at just ₹399/month and include free automated backups, snapshot support, and DDoS protection as standard. Whether you're running a WordPress multisite, a Node.js application, or a game server, our VPS hosting is built to handle it.

              For businesses that need maximum performance, control, and security, our dedicated server hosting provides bare-metal access to enterprise-grade hardware.

You get full IPMI access for remote server management, hardware firewall options, and unlimited bandwidth on select plans.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Dedicated servers are ideal for resource-intensive applications like large databases, video streaming platforms, SaaS applications, and high-traffic e-commerce stores.
